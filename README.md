# Rewardify

Rewardify is a multichain dashboard built on BOS that allows communities to earn rewards through social engagement, helping projects gain momentum.

Every project, company, collective, or individual has a community. Most fail to properly organize their community and leverage its power. Rewardify provides a tooling to align incentives in a way that boost the projects visibility while empowering the community. A project or community leader can create social tasks, such as like or retweet a Twitter post, and set a reward amount. Community members then complete tasks and earn rewards, creating a wave of cheap engagement while keeping the money inside of the community. Through multi-chain integration, this is accessible to communities on various different chains.

## What we tried

- 2 NEAR BOS components for airdrop rewards creation and claiming.
- XMTP for a faster claim interface from mobile wallets.
- node.js/Firebase/Scaffold-ETH because we still need some web2 tech to bring it all together.
- WorldCoin for sybil resistance when claiming for the first time.
- Experimented with UMA to research more complex reward flows.
- Tried deploying on a few L2s. Some worked well, others not so much.
